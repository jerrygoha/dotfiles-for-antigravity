```markdown
## Research Question
[Clear statement of what you're trying to learn]

## Constraints
- Time budget: [X hours]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
- Decision deadline: [Date]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Answer key questions
- [ ] Provide recommendations
- [ ] Include evidence/citations
```

### 2. Gather Information

**Primary Sources:**
- Official documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Technical blogs from maintainers

**Secondary Sources:**
- Stack Overflow answers
- Community discussions
- Tutorial sites

**Verify Recency:**
- Check publication date
- Verify for current version compatibility

### 3. Analyze & Compare

For technology comparisons:

```markdown
## Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Learning Curve | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Community | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Maintenance | Active | Active | Slow |
| Bundle Size | 45KB | 120KB | 30KB |
```

### 4. Document Findings

```markdown
## Research Summary

### Key Findings
1. [Finding 1 with source citation]
2. [Finding 2 with source citation]

### Pros and Cons

**Option A: [Name]**
- ✅ Pro 1
- ✅ Pro 2
- ❌ Con 1

**Option B: [Name]**
- ✅ Pro 1
- ❌ Con 1
- ❌ Con 2

### Recommendation
[Your recommendation with reasoning]

### Sources
1. [Title](URL) - [Brief description]
2. [Title](URL) - [Brief description]
```

### 5. Save Research

// turbo
```bash
mkdir -p docs/research
# Save to docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md
```

## Citation Format

```markdown
According to [Source Name](URL):
> "Direct quote if applicable"

This suggests that...
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ Verify information from multiple sources
- ✅ Check dates for recency
- ✅ Include counterarguments
- ✅ Cite all sources
